## Principles

### Do Fewer things
* Story of Jane Austen
* Zoom Apocalypse
* Overhead tax of knowledge work
    * It can reach a tipping point where administrative tasks prevent us from moving forward with new projects
* Remote work had a modest increase on the overhead tax -> it was enough to push us beyond that tipping point
* The situation was bad even pre-covid, Covid just made it worse
* Our brains perform better if we are not rushing
* Focusing on small number of tasks -> better output
* Most knowledge workers take sustainable overhead tax
    * We don't turn away from incoming tasks until we hit the tipping point
    * This technique prolongs the pain and creates a persistent sense of burnout
* Focus on fewer things -> better results
* This does not mean to achieving less, by focusing on a fewer things, you actually accomplish more


#### Proposition: Limit the big
* Story of Andrew Will (mathematician)
* Limit Missions
    * 1: too idealistic
    * 2-3: optimal
    * > 5: too much
* Limit Projects
    * book them into the calendar so you can say no more confidently to new requests
    * limit the time you spend on each projects
    * padding the time to make sure you have enough time to complete the task
* Limit daily goals
    * Try to work on only one project per day

#### Proposition: Contain the small
* Story of Benjamin Franklin

## Conclusion (so far)
* As a non native speaker, I find the language in this book a bit complex. Apart from that, it's very interesting. I'm a big fan of Cal Newport, so I might be a bit biased in my opinion.
